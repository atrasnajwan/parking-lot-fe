## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.development`
   - Update the variables if needed:
     - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Backend API URL
     - `VITE_PORT`: Frontend development server port
4. Make sure the [backend server](https://github.com/atrasnajwan/parking-lot) is running
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: The URL of the backend API (default: `http://localhost:3000`)
- `VITE_PORT`: The port for the development server (default: `5173`)

For development:

   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   VITE_PORT=5173
   ```
2. Adjust values as needed for your environment

For production:
1. Create `.env.production` file with:
   ```env
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-production-api-url
